OVERVIEW

The ModelValidator.py script takes the following input:

    1. a satisfiable SMT-LIB v2 problem that has a (set-option :produce-models true)
    command and exactly one (check-sat) command followed by one (get-model) command.

    2. the model returned by an SMT solver having the following structure:
        sat
        (model
            (define-fun  <var> () <type> <const>)
            ...
        )
    where <var> is the name of a bit-vector or boolean variable occurring in the
    original problem, <type> is the Boolean or bit-vector type of the variable and
    <const> is a constant value of the appropriate type.

The validator will output VALID if the model is a full model that satisfied the
input problem. It will output INVALID followed by a reason if the model validation
did not succeed.

The model is validated by using pySMT to substitute the model in the original
formula and checking that is simplifies to True.

USAGE

ModelValidator.py [-h] --smt2 SMT2 --model MODEL

INSTALLATION

The script requires that pySMT is currently installed. See https://pysmt.readthedocs.io
for instructions on how to install pySMT.
